# Kalanta Calculator
Kalanta is a traditional form of Christmas caroling in Greece, where groups of children go door to door to spread holiday cheer and good wishes. One unique aspect of kalanta is the custom of collecting money in return for their musical performances. As the children sing, neighbors and homeowners often offer small donations or treats as a gesture of appreciation for the joyful tunes.

This app is a simple euro bill and coin calculator but themed for kalanta. How is it any different than any other euro calculator? It isn't lol.
